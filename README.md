A module for working with the power set (all subsets of a given set).

# Installation
Clone the repo and include via script tags if used on the client side and 'require' if used on the server. I haven't uploaded to npm or bower yet.

# Tests
Open 'runner.html' and view the console. JS source file is tests/tests.js.  I've structured the tests in such a way that you can quickly see the relevant tests.js line number for each test and audit accordingly.
